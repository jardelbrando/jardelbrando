  I am Jardel Brandão dos Santos, a developer seeking to explore new technologies and knowledge 👀. I have worked on several projects using Spring, Node, React, and React Native, some of which are related to PostgreSQL or other databases. I aim to continuously improve my skills and share my learning through the commits made here 😁.
